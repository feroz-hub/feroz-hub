## 🏢 Enterprise Profile

I architect **mission-critical backend infrastructure** for organizations scaling from startup to enterprise. My engineering practice centers on eliminating technical debt through structural discipline—not quick fixes.

**Core Competencies:**
- **System Architecture:** Clean Architecture, CQRS, Event-Driven Microservices
- **Security Engineering:** Threat modeling, secure authentication flows, vulnerability assessment
- **Performance at Scale:** Distributed systems, database optimization, caching strategies
- **Technical Leadership:** Architecture reviews, team enablement, engineering standards

**Industries:** FinTech | HealthTech | SaaS | Enterprise Software

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

> *"Code is a liability. Architecture is an asset."*

**Principles That Govern Every System:**

- **Explicit Over Implicit** — Domain logic visible in code structure, not buried in frameworks
- **Security by Design** — Threat modeling before implementation, not after deployment
- **Observable by Default** — Distributed tracing, structured logging, health checks built-in
- **Failure as Feature** — Circuit breakers, graceful degradation, chaos engineering readiness
- **Evolutionary Architecture** — Systems that adapt without rewrite
